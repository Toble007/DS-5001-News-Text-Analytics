# DS-5001-News-Text-Analytics
Final Project from UVA's DS 5001 Exploratory Text Analytics

986,461 online news articles from 15 different papers were examined from the Newzy dataset. Several models were built with the aim of finding similar news sources. 9 of the news sources were grouped into 3 separate groups based on both observations discovered with models and explained with some domain knowledge.

Data comes from newzy.zip in the File Project Data Sources(https://virginia.app.box.com/s/bj8f1khrkfd6thm9umq35m6xp2an4zej/file/624341579635). This needs to be downloaded and unzipped to run code.
